<h1>JavaScripTools Manual</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<h3>The file disposition on the release archive</h3>
<p>The download archive has the following structure:<br>
<pre>
   /
   +--- changelog
   +--- javascriptools-doc.xml
   +--- css
   +-+- docs
     +--- api
     +--- manual
   +-+- js
     +--- original
   +--- samples
</pre></p>
<p>The scripts are located under the js directory, under 2 forms:<ul>
<li>Directly on the js directory, compressed using 
<a href="http://javascriptzip.sourceforge.net">JavaScriptZip</a>,
which removes all comments and unnecessary whitespaces, which reduces the file sizes
about 50%. These files are recommended for production, because they load faster, but are hard
for a human to understand them.</li>
<li>On the js/original directory. Here are the original scripts. If you are debugging
you might want to use them.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The documentation, located on the docs directory is split into two main documents: This manual and the 
API documentation, which contains details on all functions and classes, and is build using
<a href="http://jsxmldoc.sourceforge.net">JavaScriptXmlDoc</a> (the javascriptools-doc.xml file is the source
to be processed by JavaScriptXmlDoc to generate the documentation).</p>
